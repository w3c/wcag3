        </p>
    </section>
    <section id='sotd'>
        <p>This is an updated draft of the WCAG 3.0 Explainer. It is informative, not normative, and is not expected to
            become a W3C Recommendation. It provides background on [[[WCAG3]]].</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 is a successor to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 [[WCAG22]]
            and previous versions. It does not deprecate WCAG 2. It may incorporate content from User Agent
            Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[UAAG20]] and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[ATAG20]]. These
            versions provided a model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. Changing technology and changing needs
            of people with disabilities require a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively.
        </p>
        <p>This Explainer includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Goals for WCAG 3.0;</li>
            <li>WCAG 3.0 background and development history;</li>

    <section>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of WCAG is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a
            variety of platforms. WCAG 3 will use a model that allows it to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>address more disability needs than WCAG 2,</li>
            <li>incorporate publishing requirements and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual and
                mixed reality) and voice input,</li>
            <li>facilitate maintenance, so that the new model will be more enduring over time as technologies evolve,
                and</li>
            <li>include additional information about the ways web technologies need to work with authoring tools, user
                agents, and assistive technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional goals for WCAG 3.0 are written in <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3</a>. These are based on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive">Silver research</a>, the
            results from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/">Silver Design
                Sprint</a>, and input from the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the Silver Task Force, and the
            Silver Community Group.</p>

        <h3>Goals for Inclusion</h3>
        <p>The creation process for the WCAG 3.0 guidelines should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actively recruit a diverse range of people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Periodically evaluate inclusive features of available tooling and procedures.</li>
            <li>Facilitate global participation and feedback.</li>
            <li>Review and monitor participation and representation.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>W3C strives to be as inclusive as possible, and has actively sought participation and input from a broad
                range of stakeholder groups. We recognize, however, that there is always room for improvement in
                practices to support inclusion and representation. As you evaluate this document, please consider
                whether there are ways the Working Group can better support your review, feedback, or inclusion within
                the process of creating this standard. We welcome feedback on this question as part of your comments.
            </p>

        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>Several items are out of scope for WCAG 3.0:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-web technologies.</li>
            <li>Normative requirements for platforms, operating systems, software in the web technology stack, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WCAG 3.0 Background and Development History</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 originally had a project name of "Silver", so the original groups working on it and much of the
            early design work carries that project name. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working
            Group (AG) and the W3C Silver Community group partnered to produce the needs, requirements, and structure
            for the new accessibility guidance. They worked on Silver from 2017-2023. During that time they:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Developed a list of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Job_Stories_for_Stakeholders">stakeholders
                    and their job stories</a></li>

        <h2>Current Process for Creating WCAG 3.0</h2>
        <p>The AG uses an iterative approach to creating WCAG 3.0. Each piece of content will evolve over time,
            increasing in maturity. As a result, the document is a work-in-progress.</p>
        <p>Because different parts of the document have different maturity levels, each normative section includes a
            status that indicates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how far along in the development process this section is,</li>
            <li>how ready it is for experimental adoption, and</li>
            <li>what kind of feedback AG is looking for.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The status indicators, from least to most mature, are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary. It shows the type of content or section to
                expect. Placeholder text will be replaced. By default it is not included in the Editor's draft. No
                feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory</strong>: The working group is exploring what direction to take with this content.
                This content is not refined; details and definitions may be missing. By default it is not included in
                the Editor's draft. AG invites feedback on the proposed direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not
                all high-level concerns have been settled. Details are included, yet they are not all agreed on. AG
                invites feedback on how understandable, usable, and reasonable the content is.</li>
            <li><strong>Refining</strong>: The working group has reached consensus on this section. It is ready for
                broad public review and experimental adoption. AG invites feedback on feasibility and issues with
                implementations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mature</strong>: The working group thinks this content is ready for the final standard. Feedback
                should focus on edge case scenarios the working group might not have anticipated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The working group aims to publish two new drafts each year. Each draft will include targeted questions for the 
            public to consider and respond to in order to advance the working draft. Content will evolve and there may be 
            changes to layout and style that are not yet reflected in all parts of the present release and will be reflected 
            in future releases.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="structure">
        <h2>Draft WCAG 3.0 Structure</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes both normative and informative guidance. This guidance is organized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guidelines (Outcome Statements) - normative
                <ul>
                    <li>Foundational Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Supplemental Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assertions - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Details on each are below.</p>
        <p>By default, guidelines are organized by what is tested. WCAG 3.0 will provide a version, similar to the
            existing <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">QuickRef</a>, that incorporates tags to allow
            readers to reorganize and filter the content. For example, content will be tagged Perceivable, Operable,
            Understandable, and Robust so that readers can view WCAG 3.0 criteria in the same structure as WCAG 2.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Guidelines are written as plain language, user-centered outcomes statements.</p>
        <p>Guidelines include high-level, plain-language information for managers, policy makers, individuals who are
            new to accessibility, and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not the technical
            details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that anyone can
            learn about and understand the concepts. </p>
        <p>Guidelines are normative.</p>
        <p>Guidelines are technology-agnostic and address functional needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more.
          Foundational requirements, supplemental requirements, and assertions that relate 
            to a Guideline are listed together to encourage adoption of higher levels of accessibility.</p>

        <h3>Requirements and Methods</h3>
        <p>Each Guideline contains multiple Requirements:
            <ul><li>Foundational Requirements will be used to test the most basic level of accessibility.  This set of requirements will
                cover a similar, but not identical, set of needs as WCAG 2.2 A & AA.</li>
                <li>Supplemental Requirements will be used for higher levels of conformance.</li>
            </li></ul></p>    
         <p>Requirements reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Requirements are designed for use 
            by developers, testers, and other technical specialists.</p>
        <p>Requirements are normative.</p>

        <p>Each Requirement is associated with at least one <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-method">Method</a>.
            Methods are informative. Each method contains techniques for meeting the requirements, examples, resources, and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-set-of-tests">sets of tests</a>. Methods can apply to a
            specific technology, such as HTML, or can be more generic where the advice applies no matter what
            technology. For example, the methods supporting the Clear Language guideline.</p>

        <h3>Assertions</h3>
            <p>An Assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3.0, an
                Assertion is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the
                development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility.</p>
    
            <h4>Using Assertions</h4>
            <p>Assertions may supplement Requirement to meet a Guideline. Not all Guidelines include Assertions. Those that do
                list the Assertions with the Requirements. Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure to
                claim conformance. Results when testing assertions are true/false - the organization making the assertion
                either provided the required documentation or it did not.</p>

            <div class="ednote"></div>
            <p>An alternative to specifying assertions at the requirement or guideline level might be to require that the
                    assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented at the organization level, during design and development, or
                during testing.</p>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used during implementation might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training,</li>
                <li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments,</li>
                <li>Skills testing,</li>
                <li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes, or</li>
                <li>Setting the priority for remediation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used to evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Usability testing,</li>
                <li>Heuristic evaluation, or</li>
                <li>Testing with assistive technology.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>WCAG recommends maintaining additional information that an organization can use to improve or validate
                procedures and assertions. WCAG will not require organizations to provide supporting documentation to
                conform.</p>
                <h4>Documenting Assertions</h4>
                <p>Assertions must be documented as part of the conformance claim process. The required information may also be
                    made available through the web site.</p>
                <p>Assertions might include the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The statement being asserted,</li>
                    <li>The date of the assertion,</li>
                    <li>The date or date range the procedure was completed,</li>
                    <li>The scope of the assertion,</li>
                    <li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion, and</li>
                    <li>The requirement(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="ednote">
                    <p>Within the current draft, Foundational Requirements are organized as a decision tree under the relevant Guidelines. 
                        Supplemental Requirements and Assertions are then listed below the tree. AG hopes this will assist readers in 
                        determining which Requirements and Assertions to use. The AG requests feedback on three
                        early draft examples of this approach: Focus Appearance, Implied Meaning, and Text Alternatives.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does the organization make it easier to understand the Guideline, Requirements and Assertions?</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>The AG has discussed also including recommendations which could help improve accessibility under guidelines. 
                            Recommendations are not be testable and would not contribute to conformance.</li>
                        <li>Does seeing related guidance together encourage adoption of requirements and assertions beyond the most basic set?</li>
                        <li>How can this approach be improved?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>AG will continue developing requirements and methods. Each publication will include additional or more mature examples
                        for public comment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>AG's next steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define criteria for which requirements are foundational and which are supplemental.</li>
                        <li>Develop mature examples of 2 guidelines with associated requirements, methods, tests, and How to documentation.</li>
                        <li>Mature all guidelines to the developing stage.</li>
                        <li>Further explore how conditional requirements and alternate ways to measure might be used to meet Guidelines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>AG will also continue to explore the use of assertions and welcomes feedback on the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can assertions be used to record accessibility work that is not required in the guidelines? This
                            could include advance work on guidance not yet added to the guidelines.</li>
                        <li>What optional supporting documentation should organizations provide with an assertion?</li>
                        <li>Is there a need for WCAG 3.0 to require proof of an assertion, and if so, what documentation should
                            be required as proof?</li>
                        <li>Should assertions be dated, expire, or be reviewed on a regular basis?</li>
                        <li>Can steps in a procedure duplicate tests in other parts of the guidelines? If so, how should those
                            be handled?</li>
                        <li>Can assertions exist outside of conformance? For example, can they be used as an internal benchmark
                            rather than for a claim of conformance?</li>
                        <li>Can assertions be used at the most basic level of conformance? If so, how?</li>
                        <li>How can small organizations use assertions without unrealistic burden?</li>
                        <li>As written, supplemental requirements and assertions are at. Would moving assertions to the test level
                            be more effective?</li>
                        <li>AG is considering what will qualify as a procedure in WCAG 3.0. A procedure may be limited to
                            guidance:
                            <ul>
                                <li>approved by AG and listed in WCAG,</li>
                                <li>that references publicly published guidance, or</li>
                                <li>that meets criteria specified in WCAG</li>
                            </ul>
                        or it may be any process that an organization uses to improve accessibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <h5>Types of tests</h5>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantifiable tests: Tests where there is a high degree of reliability between test results from different
                testers. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a
                value specified by the requirement.</li>
            <li>Qualitative tests: Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results
                may vary between testers who understand the criteria. Variation can be reduced with clear guidance. 
                One example is evaluating the quality of alternative text used to meet a requirement for alternative text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based
            on a specific condition being met. For example, different human languages have different readability
            metrics.</p>
        
        <h5>Example Tests</h5>
        <p>Tests may be objective or subjective. For example, from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/">Image has
                    non-empty accessible name</a></li>
            <li>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/">Text
                    has minimum contrast</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both these tests are objectively verifiable. They are not subject to variation of results between different
            testers.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Alternatively, again from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/">Image accessible name
                    is descriptive</a></li>
            <li>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed">Form
                    field label is descriptive</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These tests include a subjective determination of whether they are adequately met.</p>

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>Testing uses items, views, task flow, and the product to define the scope of what is
            being tested.</p>
        <p>Items are the smallest testable unit. They could be interactive components such as a drop down menu, a link,
            or a media player. They could also be units of content such as a phrase, a paragraph, a label or error
            message, an icon, or an image.</p>
        <p>Views include all content visually and programmatically available without a significant change. Conceptually,
            views correspond to the definition of a web page as used in WCAG 2, but are not restricted to content
            meeting that definition. For example, a view could be considered a “screen” in a mobile app or a layer of
            web content, such as a modal dialog.</p>
        <p>Task flows are a series views that support a specified user activity. A task flow may include a subset of
            items in a view or a group of views. Only the part of the views that support the user activity are included
            in a test of the task flow.</p>

        <p>Examples of a task flow include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Logging into a web site and being verified as a user;</li>
            <li>Ordering an item, including the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the
                shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
            <li>Submitting tax information; and</li>
            <li>Chatting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The product is the combination of all items, views, and task flows that comprise the web site, set of web
            pages, web app, etc.</p>

        <h4>Conditions</h4>
        <p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing
            which specifications are being tested. Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what
            conditions a test applies. Both quantitative and qualitative tests can be conditional.</p>
        <p>Example conditions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language used may have different grammatical rules.</li>
            <li>An interface with multiple contrast modes may have different contrast requirements than an interface
                with only a default contrast mode.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Testing Assertions</h4>
    <p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation
        requirements for assertions (See <a>Documenting Assertions</a>). Conforming to WCAG does not require testing
        supporting documentation; however, organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements
        based on the procedure being asserted.</p>

    <section id="conformance-models">
        <h2>Draft Conformance Approach</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 will use a different conformance model than WCAG 2.0 in order to meet its requirements. Developing
            and vetting the conformance model is a large portion of the work AG needs to complete over the next few
            years. Drafts will include maturity models for public review and comment. </p>

        <p>AG is exploring a model based on Foundational Requirements, Supplemental Requirements, and Assertions.</p>

        <p>The most basic level of conformance will require meeting all of the Foundational Requirements. This set will be somewhat
            comparable to WCAG 2.2 A & AA.</p>
            
       <p>Higher levels of conformance will be defined and met using Supplemental Requirements and Assertions. AG will be exploring
        whether meeting the higher levels would work best based on points, percentages, or predefined sets of provisions (modules).</p>

        <h3>Additional Concepts</h3>    
        <p>Key concepts AG has and previously considered and continues to explore the following:
            <ul><li>Bronze, Silver and Gold conformance levels: AG has considered using three traditionally named conformance levels. 
                <ul><li>Bronze would be the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the
                    bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. The subset will require enough requirements and
                    assertions to improve equity across functional needs.</li>
                <li>Silver level incentivizes organizations to go further to improve accessibility. The goal is to encourage 
                    organizations to go beyond the minimum, especially where organizations want to be recognized for their efforts to go beyond minimum
                    accessibility.</li>
                <li>Gold level identifies measures we want to include for those organizations that do achieve
                    Silver so that some can stand out as exemplary, cutting edge, and role models.</li></ul>    
                <li>Issue severity: Severity ratings could contribute towards scoring and prioritization.</li>
                <li>Adjectival ratings: Adjectival Ratings allow test results to go beyond Pass or Fail to show progress towards a goal or
                    exceeding a goal. Example of possible adjectival ratings are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fail, Pass, Exceptional; or</li>
                    <li>Fail, Progress, Pass, Better, Exceptional.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Pre-assessment checks: Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to
                    assess conformance. The intent of specifying these would be to help implementers prepare for conformance
                    testing, not to create a new level of conformance. </li>
            </ul>

    <section id="schedule">
        <h2>Schedule</h2>
        <p>AG is currently <a href="https://www.w3.org/2023/11/ag-charter">chartered</a> through November 2025. The
            schedule through that time period is maintained at <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/WCAG_3_Timeline#Publication_Plan">WCAG 3.0 Timeline</a>.</p>
        <p>AG will continue to iterate within a single normative document with informative supporting documentation.
            After exploring other options such as breaking the content's into modules, the group determined that the
            fastest way forward at this time is to continue creating a single document with varying levels of maturity.
            We will revisit whether mature content can be published as informative modules as part of the next charter
            period, when content is more mature.</p>
        <p>A final schedule will be delivered as part of this charter period. WCAG 3.0 will not be published until it
            covers at least as much as WCAG 2.2.</p>
