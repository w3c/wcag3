        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 is a successor to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 [[WCAG22]]
            and previous versions. It does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2. It may incorporate some content from User Agent
            Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[UAAG20]] and Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 [[ATAG20]] where it assists authors in meeting guidelines. These versions provided a model that kept them relevant for over 10 years. Changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities require a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>The goal of WCAG is to provide information that can be used to improve the accessibility of products on a
            variety of platforms. WCAG 3 will use a model that allows it to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>address more disability needs than WCAG 2,</li>
            <li>incorporate publishing requirements and emerging technologies such as web XR (augmented, virtual, and mixed reality) and voice input,</li>
            <li>facilitate maintenance, so that the new model will be more enduring over time as technologies evolve, and</li>
            <li>include additional information about the ways web technologies need to work with <a>authoring tools</a>, <a>user agents</a>, and <a>assistive technologies</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional goals for WCAG 3.0 are written in <a
                href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0-requirements/">Requirements for WCAG 3</a>. These are based on the
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/wiki/Silver_Research_Archive">Silver research</a>, the
            results from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/silver/draft-final-report-of-silver/">Silver Design
                Sprint</a>, and input from the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group, the Silver Task Force, and the
            Silver Community Group.</p>

        <h3>Goals for Inclusion</h3>
        <p>The creation process for the WCAG 3.0 guidelines should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actively recruit a diverse range of people with disabilities.</li>
            <li>Periodically evaluate inclusive features of available tooling and procedures.</li>
            <li>Facilitate global participation and feedback.</li>
            <li>Review and monitor participation and representation.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="ednote">
            <p>W3C strives to be as inclusive as possible, and has actively sought participation and input from a broad
                range of stakeholder groups. We recognize, however, that there is always room for improvement in
                practices to support inclusion and representation. As you evaluate this document, please consider
                whether there are ways the Working Group can better support your review, feedback, or inclusion within
                the process of creating this standard. We welcome feedback on this question as part of your comments.

        <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
        <p>Several items are out of scope for WCAG 3.0:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-web technologies.</li>
            <li>Normative requirements for platforms, operating systems, software in the web technology stack, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>WCAG 3.0 Background and Development History</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 originally had a project name of "Silver", so the original groups working on it and much of the
            early design work carries that project name. The Silver Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working
            Group (AG) and the W3C Silver Community group partnered to produce the needs, requirements, and structure
            for the new accessibility guidance. They worked on Silver from 2017-2023. During that time they:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Developed a list of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <a

    <section id="current-process">
        <h2>Current Process for Creating WCAG 3.0</h2>
        <p>The AG uses an iterative approach to creating WCAG 3.0. Each piece of content will evolve over time,
            increasing in maturity. As a result, the document is a work-in-progress.</p>
        <p>Because different parts of the document have different maturity levels, each normative section includes a
            status that indicates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>how far along in the development process this section is,</li>
            <li>how ready it is for experimental adoption, and</li>
            <li>what kind of feedback AG is looking for.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The status indicators, from least to most mature, are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary. It shows the type of content or section to
                expect. Placeholder text will be replaced. By default it is not included in the Editor's draft. No
                feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploratory</strong>: The working group is exploring what direction to take with this content.
                This content is not refined; details and definitions may be missing. By default it is not included in
                the Editor's draft. AG invites feedback on the proposed direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Developing</strong>: There is rough agreement on what is needed for this section, although not
                all high-level concerns have been settled. Details are included, yet they are not all agreed on. AG
                invites feedback on how understandable, usable, and reasonable the content is.</li>
            <li><strong>Refining</strong>: The working group has reached consensus on this section. It is ready for
                broad public review and experimental adoption. AG invites feedback on feasibility and issues with
                implementations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mature</strong>: The working group thinks this content is ready for the final standard. Feedback
                should focus on edge case scenarios the working group might not have anticipated.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The working group aims to publish two new drafts each year. Each draft will include targeted questions for the 
            public to consider and respond to in order to advance the working draft. Content will evolve and there may be 
            changes to layout and style that are not yet reflected in all parts of the present release and will be reflected 
            in future releases.</p>

        <h2>WCAG 3.0 Structure</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes both <a>normative</a> and <a>informative</a> guidance. This guidance is organized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guidelines (Outcome Statements) - normative
                <ul>
                    <li>Foundational Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Supplemental Requirements - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Methods - informative</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assertions - normative
                        <ul>
                            <li>How to Documents - informative
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Details on each are below.</p>
        <p>By default, guidelines are organized by what is tested. WCAG 3.0 will provide a version, similar to the
            existing <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/">QuickRef</a>, that incorporates tags to allow
            readers to reorganize and filter the content. For example, content will be tagged Perceivable, Operable,
            Understandable, and Robust so that readers can view WCAG 3.0 criteria in the same structure as WCAG 2.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>Guidelines are written as plain language, user-centered outcomes statements.</p>
        <p>Guidelines include high-level, plain-language information for managers, policy makers, individuals who are
            new to accessibility, and other individuals who need to understand the concepts but not the technical
            details. They provide an easy-to-understand way of organizing and presenting the outcomes so that anyone can
            learn about and understand the concepts. </p>
        <p>Guidelines are normative.</p>
        <p>Guidelines are <a>technology-agnostic</a> and address functional needs on specific topics, such as contrast, forms, readability, and more.
          Foundational requirements, supplemental requirements, and assertions that relate 
            to a Guideline are listed together to encourage adoption of higher levels of accessibility.</p>

        <h3>Requirements and Methods</h3>
        <p>Each Guideline contains multiple Requirements:
            <ul><li>Foundational Requirements will be used to test the most basic level of accessibility.  This set of requirements will
                cover a similar, but not identical, set of needs as WCAG 2.2 Level AA.</li>
                <li>Supplemental Requirements will be used for higher levels of conformance.</li>
            </li></ul></p>    
         <p>Requirements reduce or eliminate barriers that people with disabilities experience. Requirements are designed for use 
            by developers, testers, and other technical specialists.</p>
        <p>Requirements are normative.</p>
        <p>Each set of Foundational Requirements are organized into a decision tree to show the relationship between requirements and 
            to allow for accessibility-supported soluitions in the future.</p>

        <p>Each Requirement is associated with at least one <a>Method</a>.
            Methods are informative. Each method contains techniques for meeting the requirements, examples, resources, and
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/#dfn-set-of-tests">sets of tests</a>. Methods can apply to a
            specific technology, such as HTML, or can be more generic where the advice applies no matter what
            technology. For example, the methods supporting the Clear Language guideline.</p>

        <p class="ednote">The AG has discussed also including "Recommendations" at the same level as Supplemental Requirements. Recommendations would be things which could help improve accessibility but may not be objectively testable. They could contribute to levels of conformance above Foundational.</p>

        <h3>Assertions</h3>
            <p>An Assertion is a formal claim of fact, attributed to a person or organization. In WCAG 3.0, an
                Assertion is an attributable and documented statement of fact regarding procedures practiced in the
                development and maintenance of the content or product to improve accessibility.</p>
    
            <h4>Using Assertions</h4>
            <p>Assertions may supplement Requirements to meet a Guideline. Not all Guidelines include Assertions. Guidelines that include Assertions, list the Assertions with the Requirements. Organizations can make an assertion that they followed a procedure as part of a conformance claim. Assertions can be made in addition to foundational requirements but do not replace foundational requirements.</p>

            <div class="ednote">
                <p>The working group will consider whether assertions may be used to meet guidelines when requirements are not available.</p>
                <p>An alternative to specifying assertions at the requirement or guideline level might be to require that the assertion apply to the scope of the conformance claim.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Procedures used in assertions may be implemented at the organization level, during design and development, or
                during testing.</p>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used during implementation might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Training,</li>
                <li>FTE (Full Time Equivalent) assignments,</li>
                <li>Skills testing,</li>
                <li>Coordination and documentation of accessibility processes, or</li>
                <li>Setting the priority for remediation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Examples of procedures that may be used to evaluate accessibility might include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Usability testing,</li>
                <li>Heuristic evaluation, or</li>
                <li>Testing with assistive technology.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>WCAG recommends maintaining additional information that an organization can use to improve or validate
                procedures and assertions. WCAG will not require organizations to provide supporting documentation to
                conform.</p>
                <h4>Documenting Assertions</h4>
                <p>Assertions must be documented as part of the conformance claim process. The required information may also be
                    made available through the web site.</p>
                <p>Assertions might include the following information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The statement being asserted,</li>
                    <li>The date of the assertion,</li>
                    <li>The date or date range the procedure was completed,</li>
                    <li>The scope of the assertion,</li>
                    <li>Contact information for the person or group making the assertion, and</li>
                    <li>The requirement(s) or guideline(s) supported by the assertion.</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="ednote">
                    <p>AG will continue developing requirements and methods. Each publication will include additional examples, and/or more mature examples for public comment.</p>
                    <p>AG's next steps include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define criteria for which requirements are foundational and which are supplemental.</li>
                        <li>Develop mature examples of 2 guidelines with associated requirements, methods, tests, and How to documentation.</li>
                        <li>Mature all guidelines to the developing stage.</li>
                        <li>Further explore how conditional requirements and alternate ways to measure might be used to meet Guidelines.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>AG will also continue to explore the use of assertions and welcomes feedback on the following questions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Can assertions be used to record accessibility work that is not required in the guidelines? This
                            could include advance work on guidance not yet added to the guidelines.</li>
                        <li>What optional supporting documentation should organizations provide with an assertion?</li>
                        <li>Is there a need for WCAG 3.0 to require proof of an assertion, and if so, what documentation should
                            be required as proof?</li>
                        <li>Should assertions be dated, expire, or be reviewed on a regular basis?</li>
                        <li>Can steps in a procedure duplicate tests in other parts of the guidelines? If so, how should those
                            be handled?</li>
                        <li>Can assertions exist outside of conformance? For example, can they be used as an internal benchmark
                            rather than for a claim of conformance?</li>
                        <li>Can assertions be used at the most basic level of conformance? If so, how?</li>
                        <li>How can small organizations use assertions without unrealistic burden?</li>

                        <li>AG is considering what will qualify as a procedure in WCAG 3.0. A procedure may be limited to
                            guidance:
                            <ul>
                                <li>approved by AG and listed in WCAG,</li>
                                <li>that references publicly published guidance, or</li>
                                <li>that meets criteria specified in WCAG</li>
                            </ul>
                        or it may be any process that an organization uses to improve accessibility.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h4>Testing</h4>
        <h5>Types of tests</h5>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 includes two types of tests which are evaluated:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Quantifiable tests: Tests where there is a high degree of <a>reliability</a> between test results from different
                testers. Examples include testing whether certain properties exist in the content or if they match a
                value specified by the requirement.</li>
            <li>Qualitative tests: Tests that rely on a qualitative evaluation based on existing criteria. Test results
                may vary between testers who understand the criteria. Variation can be reduced with clear guidance. 
                One example is evaluating the quality of alternative text used to meet a requirement for alternative text.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most tests have prescribed ways to meet the test. In some cases, the ways to meet the test will change based
            on a specific condition being met. For example, different human languages have different readability
            metrics.</p>
        
        <h5>Example Tests</h5>
        <p>Tests may be objective or subjective. For example, from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/23a2a8/">Image has
                    non-empty accessible name</a></li>
            <li>Example for 1.4.3: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/afw4f7/proposed/">Text
                    has minimum contrast</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both these tests are objectively verifiable. They are not subject to variation of results between different
            testers.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Alternatively, again from WCAG 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Example for 1.1.1: <a
                    href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/qt1vmo/proposed/">Image accessible name
                    is descriptive</a></li>
            <li>Example for 2.4.6: <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/cc0f0a/proposed">Form
                    field label is descriptive</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>These tests include a subjective determination of whether they are adequately met.</p>

        <h4>Scope</h4>
        <p>Testing uses items, views, task flow, and the product to define the scope of what is
            being tested.</p>
        <p>Items are the smallest testable unit. They could be interactive components such as a drop down menu, a link,
            or a media player. They could also be units of content such as a phrase, a paragraph, a label or error
            message, an icon, or an image.</p>
        <p>Views include all content visually and <a>programmatically</a> available without a <a>significant change</a>. Conceptually,
            views correspond to the definition of a web page as used in WCAG 2, but are not restricted to content
            meeting that definition. For example, a view could be considered a “screen” in a mobile app or a layer of
            web content, such as a modal dialog.</p>
        <p>Task flows are a series views that support a specified <a>user activity</a>. A task flow may include a subset of
            items in a view or a group of views. Only the part of the views that support the user activity are included
            in a test of the task flow.</p>

        <p>Examples of a task flow include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Logging into a web site and being verified as a user;</li>
            <li>Ordering an item, including the entire set of tasks from searching for the item, adding it to the
                shopping cart, paying for it, and receiving confirmation;</li>
            <li>Submitting tax information; and</li>
            <li>Chatting with other users in a virtual reality environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The product is the combination of all items, views, and task flows that comprise the web site, set of web
            pages, web app, etc.</p>

        <h4>Conditions</h4>
        <p>Some tests only apply in certain situations. Testing may occasionally require determining and referencing
            which specifications are being tested. Methods will note whether a test always applies or under what
            conditions a test applies. Both quantifiable and qualitative tests can be conditional.</p>
        <p>Example conditions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language used may have different grammatical rules.</li>
            <li>An interface with multiple contrast modes may have different contrast requirements than an interface
                with only a default contrast mode.</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Testing Assertions</h4>
    <p>The quality of an assertion can be tested based on how well the assertion meets the documentation
        requirements for assertions (See <a>Documenting Assertions</a>). Conforming to WCAG does not require testing
        supporting documentation; however, organizations may decide to adopt additional documentation requirements
        based on the procedure being asserted.</p>

    <section id="conformance-models" data-status="exploratory">
        <h2>Conformance Approach</h2>
        <p>WCAG 3.0 will use a different conformance model than WCAG 2.2 in order to meet its requirements. Developing
            and vetting the conformance model is a large portion of the work AG needs to complete over the next few
            years. Drafts will include maturity models for public review and comment. </p>

        <p>AG is exploring a model based on Foundational Requirements, Supplemental Requirements, and Assertions.</p>

        <p>The most basic level of conformance will require meeting all of the Foundational Requirements. This set will be somewhat
            comparable to WCAG 2.2 Level AA.</p>
            
       <p>Higher levels of conformance will be defined and met using Supplemental Requirements and Assertions. AG will be exploring
        whether meeting the higher levels would work best based on points, percentages, or predefined sets of provisions (modules).</p>

        <h3>Additional Concepts</h3>    
        <p>Key concepts AG has and previously considered and continues to explore the following:
            <ul><li>Bronze, Silver and Gold conformance levels: AG has considered using three traditionally named conformance levels. 
                <ul><li>Bronze would be the minimum conformance level. Content that does not meet the requirements of the
                    bronze level does not conform to WCAG 3.0. The subset will require enough requirements and
                    assertions to improve <a>equity</a> across functional needs.</li>
                <li>Silver level incentivizes organizations to go further to improve accessibility. The goal is to encourage 
                    organizations to go beyond the minimum, especially where organizations want to be recognized for their efforts to go beyond minimum
                    accessibility.</li>
                <li>Gold level identifies measures we want to include for those organizations that do achieve
                    Silver so that some can stand out as exemplary, cutting edge, and role models.</li></ul>    
                <li>Issue severity: Severity ratings could contribute towards scoring and prioritization.</li>
                <li>Adjectival ratings: Adjectival Ratings allow test results to go beyond Pass or Fail to show progress towards a goal or
                    exceeding a goal. Example of possible adjectival ratings are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fail, Pass, Exceptional; or</li>
                    <li>Fail, Progress, Pass, Better, Exceptional.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Pre-assessment checks: Pre-Assessment checks are tests or criteria that implementers can use to determine if they are ready to
                    assess conformance. The intent of specifying these would be to help implementers prepare for conformance
                    testing, not to create a new level of conformance. </li>
            </ul>  
        <section id="accessibility-supported">
            <h3>Only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies</h3>

            <p>The concept of "accessibility-supported" is to account for the variety of user-agents and scenarios. How does an author know that a particular technique for meeting a guideline will work in practice with user-agents that are used by real people?</p>

            <p>The intent is for the responsibility of testing with user-agents to vary depending on the level of conformance.</p> 

            <p>At the foundational level of conformance assumptions can be made by authors that methods and techniques provided by WCAG 3 work. At higher levels of conformance the author may need to test that a technique works, or check that available user-agents meet the requirement, or a combination of both.</p>

            <p>This approach means the working group will ensure that methods and techniques included do have reasonably wide and international support from user-agents, and there are sufficient techniques to meet each outcome.</p>

            <p>The intent is that WCAG 3 will use a content-management-system to support tagging of methods/techniques with support information. There should also be a process where interested parties can provide information.</p>

            <p>An "accessibility support set" is used at higher levels of conformance to define which user-agents and assistive technologies you test with. It would be included in a conformance claim, and enables authors to use techniques that are not provided with WCAG 3.</p>

            <p>An exception for long-present bugs in assistive technology is still under discussion.</p>

    <section id="user-generated-content" data-status="placeholder">
        <h3>User-generated content</h3>
        <details class="summary">
            <summary>Summary</summary>
            <p>User-generated content is content written by the public and customers. WCAG 3.0 may use different advice or steps for user-generated content to improve accessibility than for content created by the publisher. WCAG 3.0 proposes that organizations identify user-generated content and identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility. </p>
        </details>
            <div class="ednote">
                <p>It remains to be determined how to address user-generated content that has accessibility issues; and to define what minimum thresholds might be acceptable. We expect WCAG 3 to provide this guidance within individual guidelines and outcomes and to support testing for conformance. The working group is looking at alternative requirements to apply to user-generated content guideline by guideline, and is seeking feedback on what would serve as reasonable requirements on how to best support accessibility in user-generated content with known (or anticipated) accessibility issues. </p>
                <p>One example would be “alternative text”. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) has specific guidance for providing a mechanism for alternative text. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/#gl_b23">ATAG 2.0 Guideline B.2.3</a> - “Assist authors with managing alternative content for non-text content” could be adapted to provide specific, guideline-related guidance for user generated alternative text. </p>
                <p>The working group intends to more thoroughly address the contents and the location of an accessibility statement in a future draft.</p>
            </div>
        <p>Web content publishers may include content provided by the users of their digital products. We refer to such content as “<a href="#user-generated-content">user-generated content</a>”.</p>
        <p>Examples of user-generated content include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>social media postings and comments,</li>
            <li>uploaded photographs, or</li>
            <li>uploaded videos or other multimedia.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>User-generated content is provided for publication by visitors where the content platform specifically welcomes and encourages it. User-generated content is content that is submitted through a user interface designed specifically for members of the public and customers. Use of the same user interface as an authoring tool for publication of content by agents of the publisher (such as employees, contractors, or authorized volunteers) acting on behalf of the publisher does not make that content user-generated content. The purpose of the user-generated content conformance  section is to allow WCAG 3 outcomes and methods to require additional or different steps to improve the accessibility of user-generated content.</p>
        <p>An important part of WCAG conformance is the specific guidance that is associated with individual WCAG 3 guidelines and outcomes. Not all WCAG 3 guidelines will have unique outcomes and testing for user-generated content. Unless user-generated content requirements are specified in a particular guideline, that guideline applies as written whether or not the content is user generated. </p>
    
        
        <p>The web content publisher should identify all locations of user-generated content (such as commentary on hosted content, product descriptions for consumer to consumer for sale listings, and restaurant reviews) and perform standard accessibility evaluation analysis for each. If there are no accessibility issues, the user-generated content is fully conforming.</p>
        <section>
            <h4>Steps to conform</h4>
            <p>If accessibility issues are identified, or if the web site author wants to proactively address potential accessibility issues that might arise from user-generated content, then all of the following must be indicated alongside the user-generated content or in an accessibility statement published on the web site or product that is linked from the view or page in a consistent location:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Clearly identify where user-generated content can be found on the publisher’s digital product (perhaps by id href);</li>
                <li>Clearly identify the steps taken to encourage accessibility in user-generated content such as prompting the user for alternative text for their uploaded images before they are accepted and prohibiting text attributes except as they are part of semantic markup such as strong, headings, etc.;</li>

        <p>AG will continue to iterate within a single normative document with informative supporting documentation.
            After exploring other options such as breaking the content into modules, the group determined that the
            fastest way forward at this time is to continue creating a single document with varying levels of maturity.
            We will revisit whether mature content can be published as informative modules as part of the next charter
            period, when content is more mature.</p>
        <p>A final schedule will be delivered as part of this charter period. WCAG 3.0 will not be published until it
