## Goal

Users can see which element has keyboard focus.

## What to do

Ensure focusable elements include focus indicators that are visible for people using an input device that relies on the keyboard focus to navigate.

All indicators for keyboard-focusable elements must be:

* **Present**: There is a visible indicator of keyboard focus.
* **Not obscured**: The focus indicator is not obscured or partially obscured (more than 50%, TBC) 
* **Persistent**: The focus indicator persists while the element has focus, but does not persist after the element loses focus.
* **Distinctive**: The keyboard focus indicator uses a style that is distinct from the style of other controls, so that the item in focus can be distinguished without reference to the non-focused state. 
* **Sufficiently visible**: According to the specific method (below), the indicator must be visually discernible whilst navigating.
