			<p>W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 will provide a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible to users with disabilities. Following these guidelines will address many of the needs of users with blindness, low vision and other vision impairments; deafness and hearing loss; limited movement and dexterity; speech disabilities; sensory disorders; cognitive and learning disabilities; and combinations of any of these disabilities. These guidelines address the accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices. The guidelines apply to various types of web content, including static, dynamic, interactive, and streaming content; audiovisual media; virtual and augmented reality; and alternative access presentation and control. These guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
			<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>requirements</a> and <a>assertions</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each requirement or assertion. </p>
			<p>To keep pace with changing technology, this specification is expected to be updated regularly with updates to and new methods, requirements, and guidelines that address new needs as technologies evolve. For entities that make formal claims of <a>conformance</a> to these guidelines, several levels of conformance are available to address the diverse nature of digital content and the type of testing that is performed.</p>

				<h4>Draft requirements</h4>
				<p>The list of requirements is longer than the list of success criteria in WCAG 2. This is because:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>the intent at this stage is to be as inclusive as possible of potential requirements, and</li>
					<li>WCAG 3 requirements are more granular than WCAG 2 success criteria. </li>
					</ul>
				<p>The final set of requirements in WCAG 3 will be different from what is in this draft. Requirements are likely to be added, combined, and removed. We also expect changes to the text of the requirements. Only some of the requirements will be used to meet the base level of conformance.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h4>Section status levels</h4>
				<p>As part of the WCAG 3 drafting process, each <a>normative</a> section of this document is given a status. This status is used to indicate how far along in the development this section is, how ready it is for experimental adoption, and what kind of feedback the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is looking for.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong id="status-placeholder">Placeholder</strong>: This content is temporary. It showcases the type of content to expect here. All of this is expected to be replaced. No feedback is needed on placeholder content.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-exploratory">Exploratory</strong>: This content is not refined; details and definitions may be missing. The working group is exploring what direction to take with this section. Feedback should be about the proposed direction.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-developing">Developing</strong>: This content has been roughly agreed on in terms of what is needed for this section, although not all high-level concerns have been settled. Details have been added, but are yet to be worked out. Feedback should be focused on ensuring the section is usable and reasonable, in a broad sense.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-refining">Refining</strong>: This content is ready for wide public review and experimental adoption. The working group has reached consensus on this section. Feedback should be focused on the feasibility of implementation.</li>
					<li><strong id="status-mature">Mature</strong>: This content is believed by the working group to be ready for recommendation. Feedback on this section should be focused on edge-case scenarios that the working group may not have anticipated.</li>

				<h3>About WCAG 3</h3>
				<p>This specification presents a new model and guidelines to make web content and applications accessible to people with disabilities. W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0 supports a wide set of user needs, uses new approaches to testing, and allows frequent maintenance of guidelines and related content to keep pace with accelerating technology changes. WCAG 3 supports this evolution by focusing on the <a>functional needs</a> of users. These needs are then supported by guidelines that are written as outcome statements, requirements, assertions, and technology-specific methods to meet those needs.</p>
				<p>WCAG 3 is a successor to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2</a> [[WCAG22]] and previous versions, but does not <a>deprecate</a> WCAG 2. It will also incorporate some content from and partially extend <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UAAG20/"> User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[UAAG20]] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/"> Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [[ATAG20]]. These earlier versions provided a flexible model that kept them relevant for over 15 years. However, changing technology and changing needs of people with disabilities have led to the need for a new model to address content accessibility more comprehensively and flexibly.</p>
				<p>There are many differences between WCAG 2 and WCAG 3. The WCAG 3 guidelines address the accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, wearable devices, and other Web of Things devices. The guidelines apply to various types of web content, including static, dynamic, interactive, and streaming content; visual and auditory media; virtual and augmented reality; and alternative access presentation and control methods. These  guidelines also address related web tools such as user agents (browsers and assistive technologies), content management systems, authoring tools, and testing tools.</p>
				<p>Each <a>guideline</a> in this standard provides information on accessibility practices that address documented <a>user needs</a> of people with disabilities. Guidelines are supported by multiple <a>requirements</a> to determine whether the need has been met. Guidelines are also supported by technology-specific <a>methods</a> to meet each requirement. </p>
				<p>Content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 Level A and Level AA is expected to meet most of the minimum conformance level of this new standard but, since WCAG 3 includes additional tests and different scoring mechanics, additional work will be needed to reach full conformance. Since the new standard will use a different conformance model, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group expects that some organizations may wish to continue using WCAG 2, while others may wish to migrate to the new standard. For those that wish to migrate to WCAG 3, the Working Group will provide transition support materials, which may use mapping and other approaches to facilitate migration.</p>

			<h2>Guidelines</h2>
				<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>The following guidelines are being considered for WCAG 3. They are currently a list of topics which we expect to explore more thoroughly in future drafts. The list includes current WCAG 2 guidance and additional requirements. The list will change in future drafts.</p>
				<p>Unless otherwise stated, requirements assume the content described is provided both visually and <a>programmatically</a>.</p>
			</details>
		
			
			<div class="ednote">
			<p>The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. To meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance will be provided including guidelines written as outcome statements, requirements that can be tested, assertions, a rich collection of methods, resource links, and code samples.</p>

				<p><strong> The following list is an initial set of potential guidelines and requirements that the Working Group will be exploring. The goal is to guide the next phase of work. They should be considered drafts and should not be considered as final content of WCAG 3.0</strong>.</p>

			<p>Ordinarily, exploratory content includes editor's notes listing concerns and questions for each item.  Because this Guidelines section is very early in the process of working on WCAG 3, this editor's note covers most of the content in this section.  Unless otherwise noted, all items in the list are exploratory at this point. It is a list of all possible topics for consideration. Not all items listed will be included in the final version of WCAG 3.0.</p>

			<p>The guidelines and requirements listed below came from analysis of user needs that the Working Group has been studying, examining, and researching. They have not been refined and do not include essential exceptions or methods. Some requirements may be best addressed by authoring tools or at the platform level. Many requirements need additional work to better define the scope and to ensure they apply correctly to multiple languages, cultures, and writing systems. We will address these questions as we further explore each requirement.  </p>

			<p id="additional_research"><strong>Additional Research</strong></p>
			<p>One goal of publishing this list is to identify gaps in current research and request assistance filling those gaps.</p>
			<p> Editor's notes indicate the requirements within this list where the Working Group has not found enough research to fully validate the guidance and create methods to support it or additional work is needed to evaluate existing research.  If you know of existing research or if you are interested in conducting research in this area, please file a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag3/issues">GitHub issue</a> or send email to <a href="mailto:public-agwg-comments@w3.org?subject=WCAG%203.0%20public%20comment">public-agwg-comments@w3.org</a> (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-agwg-comments/">comment archive</a>). </p>

			<Guidelines />
		</section>

		<section id="conformance" data-status="exploratory">

			<details class="summary">
				<summary>Summary</summary>
				<p>You might want to make a claim that your <a>content</a> or <a>product</a> meets the WCAG 3 guidelines. When it meets the guidelines, you can make a "conformance claim".</p>
				<p>To make a formal conformance claim, you must use the process described in this document. Conformance claims are not required. Your content can conform to WCAG 3, even if you don't want to make a claim.</p>	
				<p>WCAG 3 has two types of content:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Normative:</b> Rules you <em>must</em> follow to meet the guidelines.</li>
					<li><b>Informative:</b> Information that helps you understand or apply those rules &mdash; This is also called <a>non-normative</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The guidelines use three kinds of provisions that set out what must be done:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Core requirements:</b> The main things you <em>must</em> do</li>
				<li><b>Supplemental requirements:</b> Additional things that you can do to make things more accessible</li>
				<li><b>Assertions:</b> Things that you can say you did or do to improve the accessibility of your content or product</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, WCAG 3 provides Best Practices. These provide important guidance that often save time and improve accessibility but may not always apply in every situation.</p>

			<p>The methods you use to satisfy WCAG 3 must be <a>accessibility supported</a>. This means a method only counts toward conformance if browsers and assistive technologies in general use support it. WCAG 3 uses defined accessibility-support sets to identify which technologies are tested against to check whether the methods used meet a requirement. The initial accessibility-support set in WCAG 3 is for HTML methods.</p>
			
			<p>When evaluating accessibility, WCAG 3 applies to a clearly defined part of your content — such as specific <a>pages</a>/<a>views</a>, or <a>processes</a> — so you can scope your claim to exactly what was tested.</p>

			<p>Each core requirement, supplemental requirement, and assertion is linked to different functional limitations. These cover a broad range of disabilities and help explain who benefits from the work to meet them.</p>
			</details>
			
			<p>This section lists requirements for conformance to WCAG 3.0. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be <a>accessibility supported</a>, since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be relied upon for conformance.</p>

			<div class="ednote" title="Goals for a new conformance model">
				<p>In this draft, AG is exploring a model based on Core Requirements, Supplemental Requirements, and Assertions. We ask reviewers to consider the following questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Should the core set of requirements be approximately the same as WCAG 2.2 A & AA? If not, should it be smaller or larger? If you think it should be a different size, what rules would you use to select the set?</li>
		            <li>Should we include assertions within the core set? Would organizations be willing to make public, attributable assertions about processes they completed?</li>
		            <li>Should there be additional levels within the core set of requirements? If yes, what and why?</li>
	            	<li>In WCAG 2, every provision within the minimum conformance level has to be met to conform at the lowest level of conformance. To conform at the lowest level in WCAG 3, every provision within the core set must be met AND then additional effort must be done to better support people with disabilities but WCAG 3 allows some flexibility on what and how that effort is provided. Does this approach work or would a stricter set of requirements with more flexibility within the methods be a preferred approach?</li>
	        	</ul>
			</div>

			<section id="interpreting-normative-provisions">
				<h3>Interpreting normative provisions</h3>

				<p>The main content of WCAG 2.2 is <a>normative</a> and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are <a>informative</a> (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.</p>

				<p>The key words <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em>, <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em>, <em class="rfc2119">MUST NOT</em>, <em class="rfc2119">NOT RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em>, <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD</em>, and <em class="rfc2119">SHOULD NOT</em> are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119]].</p>


				<h4>Types of provision</h4>

				<p>WCAG 3 consists of three types of provisions.</p>

				<p><b>Core Requirements</b> &mdash; Requirements that must be met in order to conform. These include requirements that ensure:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>contents are detectable by user agents and AT,</li>
					<li>content is conveyed to multiple senses and can be used by multiple inputs,content does not cause immediate, physical harm,</li>
					<li>necessary support is available such as captions, text alternatives, and expanded forms of abbreviations.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Supplemental Requirements</b> &mdash; Requirements that build on the core set. These include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>quality checks,</li>
					<li>stricter or higher levels than those in a comparable core requirement,</li>
					<li>requirements that are currently more difficult or expensive to implement, and</li>
					<li>requirements that may apply in certain situations.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><b>Assertions</b> &mdash; Documented statements you can make about specific accessibility practices your organization follows to improve the accessibility of your content or product.</p>

				<h4>Best practices</h4>

				<p>In addition to requirements and assertions, WCAG 3 includes best practices. These are listed at the provision and method level. They provide important guidance that often saves time and improve accessibility but may not always apply in every situation. These are integrated with requirements, assertions and methods and are clearly marked as best practice.</p>

				<p>Best practices do not need to be satisfied to conform.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="conformance-requirements">
				<h3>Conformance requirements</h3>
				<p>In order for a web page to conform to WCAG 3.0, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:</p>

				<h4>Conformance level</h4>

				<p>One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>For Bronze conformance (the minimum level of conformance), all of the </li>pages/views</a> and <a>processes</a> within the conformance scope MUST satisfy all the core requirements and some portion (to be determined) of the supplemental requirements and assertions within each functional limitations.</li>
					<li>For Silver conformance, all of the pages/views and processes within the conformance scope MUST satisfy all the core requirements and a larger portion of the supplemental requirements and assertions than in Bronze.</li>
					<li>For Gold conformance, all of the pages/views and processes within the conformance scope satisfy all the core requirements and a larger portion of the supplemental requirements and assertions than in Silver.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Accessibility supported</h4>
	
				<p>Many methods, such as those using ARIA or CSS, are only effective when they are supported by the <a>user agents</a> (UA) and <a>assistive technologies</a> (AT) of real users.</p>

				<p>The UA and AT used vary by language and region, and may be restricted in closed environments such as behind firewalls or on kiosks. As a result, it is important to understand which UA and AT support which methods and clearly state what UA and AT are assumed on conformance statements. The concept that methods must be supported by users' assistive technologies as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other user agents is referred to as "accessibility supported".</p>

				<p><img src="img/conformance-model.png" alt="diagram of the conformace model showing the core and supplemental requirements with lines for bronze, silver and gold level" style="width: 100%"></p>

				<h5>Accessibility support set</h5>

				<p>WCAG 3 includes the concept of "accessibility-support sets". This is the set of UAs, ATs, and accessibility settings that AGWG will test against when determining methods that support a requirement.</p>

				<p>WCAG 3 will use two accessibility support sets:</p>

				<ol>
					<li><b>Default accessibility-support set</b> &mdash; A set of common browsers and assistive technology and accessibility supported settings support English content. The default accessibility-support set will be for HTML methods. Additional sets may be created for technologies such as mobile or VR.</li>
					<li><b>Alternative accessibility support set</b> &mdash; People, organizations or regional regulators can also specify an alternative accessibility support set. This is a different set of browsers, assistive technology, and accessibility settings that support the intended languages, regions and technologies when the default accessibility-set does not provide that support.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>While the AGWG will strive to ensure that requirements have as broad support as possible, it may not be possible for every requirement to be met on every combination of UA and AT. AGWG will only include core requirements if they include at least one HTML method that works with the default accessibility-support set at the time of publication.</p>

				<p>The accessibility support set must be included in conformance claims. If you are working in a closed environment, with non-HTML technologies, or are in a region that relies on UA and AT outside the AG default accessibility-support set defined in WCAG 3, we also recommend including your accessibility support set in public accessibility statements. For example, if you claim conformance against a kiosk that uses a non-standard way to provide text to speech, then the accessibility-support set you are using should be included in your conformance claim and we recommend including it in public statements about the kiosk accessibility.</p>

				<div class="ednote">
					<ul>
						<li>The default accessibility support set has not yet been defined.</li>
						<li>Informative documentation will be needed to specify how people can create their own alternative accessibility support set.</li>
						<li>Maintenance of the accessibility support set over time needs additional discussion.</li>
						<li>An exception for long-present bugs in assistive technology is still under discussion.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h4>Defined conformance scope</h4>

				<p>When evaluating the accessibility of content, WCAG 3 requires the guidelines apply to a specific scope.</p>

				<p>WCAG 3 defines two ways to scope content: <a>pages</a>/<a>views</a> and <a>processes</a>. Evaluation is done on one or more complete pages/views or processes, and conformance is determined on the basis of one or more complete pages/views or processes.</p>

				<p>Conformance is defined only for clearly defined pages/views and processes. However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one pages/views and processes, a series of pages/views and processes, or multiple related pages/views and processes. All unique steps in a process <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be represented in the set of views. Views outside of the process <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> also be included in the scope.</p>

				<p class="ednote">We recognize that representative sampling is an important strategy that large and complex sites use to assess accessibility. While it is not addressed within this document at this time, our intent is to later address it within this document or in a separate document before the guidelines reach the Candidate Recommendation stage. We welcome your suggestions and feedback about the best way to incorporate representative sampling in WCAG 3.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="function-performance-statements">
				<h3>Functional performance statements (expanded)</h3>

				<p>Each core requirement, supplemental requirement, and assertion are tagged with one or more of the expanded functional performance statements below. The statements are intended to describe the functional performance of ICT enabling people to locate, identify, and operate ICT functions, and to access the information provided, regardless of physical, cognitive or sensory abilities.</p>

				<p>This is not a list of disabilities. Different disabilities may lead to the need for use with one or more of the limitations listed below. For example, a visual impairment or an inability to process visual information may require usage with limited vision.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Usage without vision </li>
					<li>Usage with limited vision </li>
					<li>Usage without perception of color    </li>
					<li>Usage without hearing</li>
					<li>Usage with limited hearing</li>
					<li>Usage without vocal capability</li>
					<li>Usage with limited vocal capability</li>
					<li>Usage with limited manipulation or strength</li>
					<li>Usage with limited reach</li>
					<li>Usage with sensitivity to sensory stimuli</li>
					<li>Usage with limited executive function (includes self regulation, task management, planning, organization and social skills)</li>
					<li>Usage with limited reasoning (includes problem solving, abstraction, mathematical intelligence, recognition, and crystallized intelligence)</li>
					<li>Usage with limited attention (includes the ability to concentrate, multitask, and focus over time)</li>
					<li>Use with sensitivity to certain content (includes anxiety and content-based triggers)</li>
					<li>Usage with limited language processing (includes the ability to process spoken language, sign language, written language, and image based language.)</li>
					<li>Usage with limited memory</li>
					<li>Usage with atypical physical attributes</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="note">
					<p>The difference between this list and the one currently used in legislation is:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Limited cognition has been broken apart to better reflect the diversity of needs within cognition-related disabilities.</li>
						<li>An alternative breakdown to usage with limited cognition based on <a href="https://w3c.github.io/fast/" target="_blank">FAST</a> would be:
							<ul>
								<li>Usage with limited attention</li>
								<li>Usage with limited language and communication</li>
								<li>Usage with limited learning</li>
								<li>Usage with limited memory</li>
								<li>Usage with limited executive function</li>
							</ul>
							<li>The following functional performance statements were added:
								<ul>
									<li>Use with limited vocal capability</li>
									<li>Use with atypical physical attributes</li>
