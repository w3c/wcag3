software, or collection of layers of software, that lies below the subject software and provides services to the subject software and that allows the subject software to be isolated from the hardware, drivers, and other software below

:::note
Platform software both makes it easier for subject software to run on different hardware, and provides the subject software with many services (e.g. functions, utilities, libraries) that make the subject software easier to write, keep updated, and work more uniformly with other subject software.
:::

:::note
A particular software component might play the role of a platform in some situations and a client in others. For example a browser is a platform for the content of the page but it also relies on the operating system below it.
:::

:::note
The platform is the context in which the :term[product] exists.
:::

:::example
* A web browser is a platform as it provides software services to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based software.
* An operating system provides software services to applications designed to run on that platform.
* An e-reader is a platform that provides software services to e-books.
