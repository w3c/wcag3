title: change of viewport within a page/view
---

change of content/context that causes the users keyboard navigation point to change where they have the option to move back out of the new content/context

:::example
Modal dialog
:::

:::note
â€œwithin a page/view is part of this term because - if the new viewport/content/context is within the same page/view going back etc. would be under the control of the author.  If moving to another page/view - perhaps on a different site - the current author would not have control and this would be a requirement on the :term[user agent].

:::note
This is different from [Change of Context in WCAG 2.x](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#dfn-change-of-context) major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneously.
