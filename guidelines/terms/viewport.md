object in which the :term[platform] presents content

:::note
The author has no control of the viewport and almost always has no idea what is presented in a viewport (e.g. what is on screen) because it is provided by the platform. On browsers the hardware platform is isolated from the content.
:::

:::note
Content can be presented through one or more viewports. Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport. For example,  nested frames. Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports.
:::

:::example
For a web page author, the viewport is the HTML viewport.

:::example
For an application developer, the viewport is the window.
