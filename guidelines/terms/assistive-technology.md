Hardware and/or software that acts as a :term[user agent], or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents

:::note
Functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).

:::note
Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.

:::note
The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.

:::example
Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:

* screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;
* screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;
* text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
* speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;
* alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
* alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.
