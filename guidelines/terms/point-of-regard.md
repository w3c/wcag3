The position in rendered :term[content] that the user is presumed to be viewing. The dimensions of the point of regard can vary.
For example, it can be a two-dimensional area (e.g. content rendered through a two-dimensional graphical viewport),
or a point (e.g. a moment during an audio rendering or a cursor position in a graphical rendering),
or a range of text (e.g. focused text), or a two-dimensional area (e.g. content rendered through a
two-dimensional graphical viewport). The point of regard is almost always within the viewport,
but it can exceed the spatial or temporal dimensions of the viewport (see the definition of
rendered content for more information about viewport dimensions).
The point of regard can also refer to a particular moment in time for content that changes over time (e.g. an audio-only presentation).
User agents can determine the point of regard in a number of ways, including based on viewport position in content, keyboard focus, and selection.
