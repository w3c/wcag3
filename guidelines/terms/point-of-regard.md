The position in rendered :term[content] that the user is presumed to be viewing. The dimensions of the point of regard can vary.

For example, it can be a two-dimensional area (e.g. content rendered through a two-dimensional graphical viewport), or a point (e.g. a moment during an audio rendering or a cursor position in a graphical rendering), or a range of text (e.g. focused text).

The point of regard is almost always within the viewport, but it can exceed the spatial or temporal dimensions of the viewport. See :term[rendered content] for more information about viewport dimensions.

The point of regard can also refer to a particular moment in time for content that changes over time. For example, an audio-only presentation.

User agents can determine the point of regard in a number of ways, including based on viewport position in content, keyboard focus, and selection.
