Captions that provide an experience beyond the display of a text alternative or a visual equivalent of the text and sounds in the audio. For example, some media players offer the following options for enhancing captions:

* Adding stylized text, including color and size differences, to emphasize information
* Adding graphics, such as labeled illustrations or concept maps
* Adding interactive elements, such as hyperlinks to glossary terms
* Adding a second work of media to accompany the primary media
* Customizing media placement
* Offering alternative playback options for captions

Enhanced captioning is also called kinetic, embodied, integral, dynamic, and animated captioning.
