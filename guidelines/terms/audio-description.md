narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack alone

:::note
For audiovisual media, :term[audio description] provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content.

Audio description is also sometimes called “video description”, “described video”, “visual description”, or “descriptive narration”.

In standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue. See also :term[extended audio description].

If all important visual information is already provided in the main audio track, no additional audio description track is necessary.
