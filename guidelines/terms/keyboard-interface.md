Place (API or service) where software receives ‘keystrokes” from.

:::note
Keystrokes that are passed to the software from the “keyboard interface” may come from a wide variety of sources including but not limited to a scanning program, for example, from sip-and-puff morse code software, speech recognition software, AI of all sorts, as well as other keyboard substitutes or special keyboards.
