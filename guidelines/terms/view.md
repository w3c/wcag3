:term[content] that is :term[actively available] in a :term[viewport] including that which can be scrolled or panned to, and any additional content that is included by expansion while leaving the rest of the content in the viewport actively available 

:::note
A modal dialog box would constitute a new view because the other content in the viewport is no longer actively available.
:::

:::example
Examples of “included by expansion” include, but are not limited to: expanding paragraphs, non-modal dialogs, non-modal popups, error messages that appear embedded in content (for example, an “invalid password” error message).
