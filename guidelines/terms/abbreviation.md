shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part of the language

:::note
This includes initialisms, acronyms, and numeronyms.

1. **initialisms** are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or syllables contained in that name or phrase. These are not defined in all languages.
2. **acronyms** are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word.
3. **numeronyms** are shortened forms of a word that use the first and last letters, with a number in between showing the number of letters left out.

:::example
In non-alphabetic writing systems, abbreviated forms are created using different linguistic units, and the alphabetic model does not apply directly. For example, in Japanese, 全国学力・学習状況調査 (National Academic Achievement and Learning Status Survey) is abbreviated as 全国学調 (National Academic Survey).

:::note
Some companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the word is no longer considered an abbreviation.
