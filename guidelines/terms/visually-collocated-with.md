in reasonable proximity within the viewport, regardless of magnification or zoom level, to sufficiently associate the error message to the field in error

From 2 February 2026 meeting:
- we added the somewhat awkward 'with' as part of the term so that the whole definition can replace the term in the requirement (without 'with' that would not work)
- the subgroup feels this could improve with a more testable definition of 'proximity', when is it enough, something like how many pixels away is enough. We need to think about how to do that.
