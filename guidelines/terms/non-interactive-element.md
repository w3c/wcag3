title: Non-interactive element
---

part of the interface that does not respond to user input and does not include sub-parts

:::example
Text, an image, a video, and if they have no sub-elements: a paragraph, list item, and table cell.
:::

:::note
If a paragraph included a link, the text either side of the link would be considered a static element, but not the paragraph as a whole.
:::

:::note
Letters within text do not constitute a “smaller part”.
