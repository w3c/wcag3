---

non-literal text uses words or phrases in a way that goes beyond their standard or dictionary meaning to express deeper, more complex ideas

:::note
This is also called figurative language.

To understand it, users have to interpret the implied meaning behind the words, rather than just their literal or direct meaning.

Examples:

- allusions
- hyperbole
- idioms
- irony
- jokes
- litotes
- metaphors
- metonymies
- onomatopoeias
- oxymorons
- personification
- puns
- sarcasm
- similes
