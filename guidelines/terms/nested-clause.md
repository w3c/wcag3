clause that is embedded inside another clause and neither clause can stand alone as a sentence 

:::note
Nested clauses use groups of words that are sometimes called dependent clauses or subordinate clauses.

:::example
"I know the teacher who said the book that you lent me was missing." The main or independent clause is "I know the teacher". It includes the dependent or subordinate clause "who said the book ... was missing", which includes the nested clause "that you lent me".
