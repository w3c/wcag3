title: Non-literal language
---

Non-literal language uses words or phrases in a way that goes beyond their standard or dictionary meaning to express deeper, more complex ideas.
This is also called figurative language.
To understand it, users have to interpret the implied meaning behind the words, rather than just their literal or direct meaning.

Examples:

- allusions
- hyperbole
- idioms
- irony
- jokes
- litotes
- metaphors
- metonymies
- onomatopoeias
- oxymorons
- personification
- puns
- sarcasm
- similes

More detailed examples are available in the :term[Methods] section.
