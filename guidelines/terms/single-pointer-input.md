input modality that only targets a single point on the :term[page]/:term[view] at a time – such as a mouse, single finger on a touch screen, or stylus

:::note
Single pointer interactions include clicks, double clicks, taps, dragging motions, and single-finger swipe gestures. In contrast, multipoint interactions involve the use of two or more pointers at the same time, such as two-finger interactions on a touchscreen, or the simultaneous use of a mouse and stylus.

:::note
Single pointer input is in contrast to multipoint input such as two, three or more fingers or pointers touching the surface, or gesturing in the air, at the same time.

:::note
Activation is usually by click or tap but can also be by programmatic simulation of a click or tap or other similar simple activation.
