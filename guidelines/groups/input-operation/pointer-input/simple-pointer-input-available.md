All functionality and content available using :term[complex pointer inputs] is also available using a :term[simple pointer input] or a sequence of simple pointer inputs that do not require timing.

:::note
Examples of complex pointer inputs are double clicking, swipe :term[gestures], multipoint gestures like pinching or split tap or two-finger rotor, variable pressure or timing, and dragging movements.
:::

:::note
Complex pointer inputs are not banned, but they cannot be the only way to accomplish an action.
:::

:::note
Simple pointer input is different than :term[single pointer input] and is more restrictive than simply using a :term[single pointer].
:::

:::tests
**Procedure:**
1. Check that any functionality that uses pointer input other than simple pointer input can also be operated by a simple pointer input or a sequence of simple pointer inputs that do not require timing.

**Expected Results:**
- Check #1 is true
