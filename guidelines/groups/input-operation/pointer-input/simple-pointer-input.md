Any functionality that uses pointer input other than :term[simple pointer input] can also be operated by a :term[simple pointer input] or a sequence of :term[simple pointer inputs] that do not require timing.

:::note
Examples of :term[pointer] input that are not simple pointer input are double clicking, swipe gestures, multipoint gestures like pinching or split tap or two-finger rotor, variable pressure or timing, and dragging movements.

:::note
:term[Complex pointer inputs] are not banned, they just can't be the only way to accomplish an action.
:::

:::note
:term[Simple pointer input] is different than :term[single pointer input] and is more restrictive than simply using a single pointer.
