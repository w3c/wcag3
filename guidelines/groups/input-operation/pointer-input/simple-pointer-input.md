Any functionality that uses :term[pointer] input other than :term[simple pointer input] can also be operated by a simple pointer input or a sequence of simple pointer inputs that do not require timing.

:::note
Examples of pointer input that are not simple pointer input are double clicking, swipe :term[gestures], multipoint gestures like pinching or split tap or two-finger rotor, variable pressure or timing, and dragging movements.
:::

:::note
:term[Complex pointer inputs] are not banned, but they cannot be the only way to accomplish an action.
:::

:::note
Simple pointer input is different than :term[single pointer input] and is more restrictive than simply using a :term[single pointer].
