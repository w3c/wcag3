If content interferes with pointer or keyboard focus behavior of the :term[user agent], then selecting anything on the :term[view] with a :term[pointer] moves the keyboard focus to that interactive element, even if the user drags off the element (so as to not activate it).

:::note
An example of this is: a user scrolls a document down six screens, then clicks on a paragraph with their :term[pointer]. The user then presses the <kbd>tab</kbd> key, which moves the focus to the first interactive component after the position on the screen that was clicked, rather than from the previous position, six screens up the document.
