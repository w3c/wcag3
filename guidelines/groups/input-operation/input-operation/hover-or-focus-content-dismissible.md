A :term[mechanism] is available to dismiss :term[content] that appears on :term[pointer] hover or :term[keyboard focus] without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content does not obscure or replace other content

:::example
Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML <code class="language-html">title</code> attribute.
:::

:::applies-when
Receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, and the visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the author and not by the :term[user agent].
:::

:::note
This applies to content that appears in addition to the triggering of the :term[interactive element] itself. Since hidden interactive elements that are made visible on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a :term[page]/:term[view]) do not present additional content, they are not covered by this :term[requirement].
:::

:::example
Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other non-modal popups that display on hover and keyboard focus.

:::tests

**Procedure**

For additional content that appears on hover check that:
1. The content can be closed without moving the pointer way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by pressing another documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.

For additional content that appears on focus check that:
1. The content can be closed without moving the focus way from the trigger. Either by pressing Esc, by pressing another other documented keyboard shortcut, or by activating the trigger.

**Expected results**

- For additional content that appears on hover: #1 is true.
- For additional content that appears on focus: #1 is true.
