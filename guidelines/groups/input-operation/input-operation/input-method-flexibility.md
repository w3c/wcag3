Where functionality, including input or navigation, are achievable using different input methods, users have the option to switch between the input methods at any time, except where a particular input method is :term[essential] to the functionality.

:::note
This does not mean that all input technologies (pointer, keyboard, voice, gesture) need to be supported in one's content, but if an input modality is supported, it is supported everywhere in the content except where a particular input method is essential to the functionality.
