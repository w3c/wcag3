Where functionality, including input or navigation, can be achieved using different input methods, users are allowed to switch between the input methods at any time, except where a particular input method is [essential](#dfn-essential-exception) to the functionality.

:::ednote
This does not mean that all input technologies (pointer, keyboard, voice, gesture) need to be supported in one's content, but if an input modality is supported, it is supported everywhere.
