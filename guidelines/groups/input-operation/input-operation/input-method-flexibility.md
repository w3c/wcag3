Where functionality, including input or navigation, is achievable using different input :term[methods], users have the option to switch between those input methods at any time.

:::note
This does not mean that all input technologies (:term[pointer], keyboard, voice, :term[gesture]) need to be supported, but if an input modality is supported, it is supported everywhere in the :term[content] except where a particular input method is :term[essential] to the functionality.
