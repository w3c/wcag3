Where there is a list of many items with repeated text in the item text, the unique information is presented first for each item (front end loaded).

:::example
For a list of departments put the name of the department first (e.g., English Department, Mathematics Department) rather than the word “department” (e.g., Department of English, Department of Mathematics).
