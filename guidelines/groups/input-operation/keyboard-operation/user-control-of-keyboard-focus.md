When the keyboard focus is moved, one of the following is true:
- The focus was moved under direct user control;
- A new :term[view] such as a dialog is introduced and focus is moved to it;
- The user is informed of the potential move and given the chance to avoid the move.

:::example
It may be useful to ask the user if they want to jump somewhere and give them the option to say no when:

- Forms say "If you answer no, you can skip questions 8 through 15", and
- An error is detected on submit: "There is an error on the page, would you like to jump to it", especially if it also provided information on what the error was.
