Except for skip links and other elements that are hidden but specifically added to aid keyboard navigation, tabbing does not move the :term[keyboard focus] into :term[content] that was not visible before the tab action.

:::note
Accordions, dropdown menus, and [ARIA tab panels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/) are examples of expandable content. According to this :term[requirement], these would not expand simply because they include an element in the tab-order contained in them. They would either not expand or would not have any tab-order elements in them.
:::

:::example
A menu that expands when you tab to it, but then uses arrow keys to navigate in it would pass. But a menu that expands and then requires you to tab through all the newly-visible elements to navigate past it would fail.
