All :term[content] that can be accessed by other input modalities can be accessed using :term[keyboard interface] only.

:::note
All content includes content made available via hovers, right clicks, etc.

:::note
Other input modalities include :term[pointing devices], voice and speech recognition, :term[gesture], :term[camera input], and any other means of input or control.

:::note
The [All Elements Keyboard-Actionable requirement](#all-elements-keyboard-actionable) allows you to navigate to all actionable elements, but if the next element is 5 screens down, you also need to be able to access all the content. Also, if the content is in expanding sections, you need to not only open them but also access all of the content, not just its actionable elements.
