All :term[content] that can be accessed by other input modalities can be accessed using :term[keyboard interface] only.

:::note
All content includes content made available via hovers, right clicks, etc.
:::

:::note
Other input modalities include :term[pointing devices], voice and speech recognition, :term[gesture], :term[camera input], and any other means of input or control.
:::

:::note
The [All Elements Keyboard-Actionable requirement](#all-elements-keyboard-actionable) allows you to navigate to all actionable elements, but if the next element is 5 screens down, you also need to be able to access all the content. Also, if the content is in expanding :term[sections], you need to not only open them but also access all of the content, not just its actionable elements.
