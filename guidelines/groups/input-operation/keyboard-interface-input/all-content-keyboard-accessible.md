All :term[content] that can be accessed by other input modalities can be accessed using :term[keyboard interface] only.

:::note
All content includes content made available via hovers, right clicks, etc.
:::

:::note
Other input modalities include :term[pointing devices], voice and speech recognition, :term[gesture], :term[camera input], and any other other means of input or control.

:::note
The [All Elements Keyboard-Actionable requirement](#all-elements-keyboard-actionable) allows you to navigate to all actionable elements but if the next element is 5 screens down - you also need to be able to access all the content. Also if the content is in expanding sections - you need to not just open them but also access all of the content - not just its actionable elements.

:::note
A menu that opens and closes is an interactive group that consists of an icon or label (which opens and closes the menu - and is therefore an interactive element) and a group of interactive elements inside.
