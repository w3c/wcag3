When the :term[keyboard focus] is moved, one of the following is true:
- The focus was moved under direct user control;
- A new :term[view], such as a dialog, is introduced and focus is moved to that view;
- The user is informed of the potential keyboard focus move before it happens and given the chance to avoid the move;
- The keyboard focus moves to the next :term[item] in keyboard navigation order automatically on completion of some user action.

:::example
Examples of where it may be useful to move the user, with approval, to some other location:
- A form message that says "If you answer no, you can skip questions 8 through 15; would you like to skip to question 16?"
- When a form error is detected on submit and a message says "There is an error on the page; would you like to jump to it?"
