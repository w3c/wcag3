The :term[keyboard focus] only moves as a result of user interaction.

:::except-when
- The keyboard focus automatically moves to the next interactive elements in keyboard navigation order on completion of some user action, such when the focus moves between the fields for a time-based one-time password (TOTP) code.
- The keyboard focus results from security or emergency situations, such as warning about an imminent session timeout that would cause the user to lose their work.
- The user is informed of the potential keyboard focus move before it happens and given the chance to avoid the move.
