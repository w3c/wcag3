The keyboard interface can always move forward to the next interactive element and back to the previous interactive element.

:::note
Although keyboard navigation is required to be bidirectional, it is not required that it be symmetrical, even though this is usually best practice.

:::note
Methods &amp; best practices:

- Method: Use standard HTML to create interactive elements.
- Avoid modifying the tab order to be in only one direction.
:::

:::example
Tabbing through menus, hitting <kbd>space</kbd> to open a menu, tabbing off the end of the menu lands you on the next menu. A <kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> may go back to the last item in the previous menu (symmetrical) or to the last menu (not symmetrical but also does not fail this requirement).

**Procedure**
1. Using the keyboard, navigate forward through the whole page or view.
2. Check that when tabbing forwards you navigate to the next interactive element.
3. Using the keyboard, navigate backward through the whole page or view.
4. Check that when tabbing backwards #2, you navigate to the previous interactive element each time.  
5. Check that during #1 and #2, when tabbing forwards or backwards, you are at no point blocked from continuing.

**Expected results**
- #2, #4, and #5 are true
