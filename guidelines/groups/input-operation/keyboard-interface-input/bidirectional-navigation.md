The keyboard interface can always move forward to the next interactive element and back to the previous interactive element.

:::note
Although keyboard navigation is required to be bidirectional, it is not required that it be symmetrical, even though this is usually best practice.
:::

:::example
Tabbing through menus, hitting <kbd>space</kbd> to open a menu, tabbing off the end of the menu lands you on the next menu. A <kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd></kbd> may go back to the last item in the previous menu (symmetrical) or to the last menu (not symmetrical but also does not fail this requirement).
