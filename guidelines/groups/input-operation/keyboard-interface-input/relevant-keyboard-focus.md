Except for skip links and other visually hidden elements specifically added to aid keyboard navigation, the keyboard focus order does not include non-interactive elements nor interactive elements in content that is currently visually hidden.

:::note
Accordions, dropdown menus, and ARIA tab panels are examples of expandable content. Expandable content would not expand unless the user makes explicit selection to do so.
