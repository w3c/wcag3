- Avoid non-standard keys where the standard keys would be just as effective.
- If you do use non-standard keys for efficiency - also support navigation with standard keys.
- Allow user to change any non-standard keyboard commands.
- Have a description of any non-standard techniques available on every :term[page] / :term[view] they are needed so no memory is required.
- Most preferable is that any non-standard are described or reminded wherever they are needed.
