The number of input commands required for a :term[process] using the keyboard is similar to the number of input commands when using other input modalities.

:::note
Other input modalities include pointer and voice.

The working group is seeking assistance/input on this. A significant access barrier is :term[views] where keyboard navigation is many times slower than pointer navigation. Even expert keyboard navigation will usually take much more time than mouse-oriented navigation. We know they can never be equal since keyboard access requires you to go step-by-step to a location whereas with a mouse you can jump there in one click. The group would like to find something more than a "best practice statement" like "be as comparable as possible". Counting keystrokes vs clicks or time-weighted keystrokes vs clicks does not work for many reasons including the variance in time it takes different users to move a pointer or to press a key - even repeatedly. We would like this to be stronger than a "best practice" item but do not yet see how to. Is there some kind of testable provision that can be created that will make keyboard access as efficient as possible? Also any techniques or other approaches to this are appreciated.
