The :term[keyboard focus] moves through :term[content] in an order and way that preserves meaning and operability.

:::tests
**Procedure:**
Use keyboard navigation to navigate through all the interactive elements on the :term[page] / :term[view] and the order appears to follow some logic.

:::note
The :term[Common Keyboard Navigation Techniques] are considered logical by default
:::
:::
Having the navigation follow a consistent pattern on the page would be an indication of logic (if it is not consistently random).
:::
:::note
A strictly start-to-end order is not required.
:::
:::note
Linear means in a single direction (forward / backward) and is not required as long the non-linear technique is in the  Keyboard Navigation Techniques or is described on the page or where the user will encounter it prior.

**Expected Results:**
- PASS: Check #2 is true
