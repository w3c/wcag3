The :term[keyboard focus] moves through :term[content] in an order and way that preserves meaning and operability.

:::tests
**Procedure**
1. Use keyboard navigation to navigate through all the interactive elements on the :term[page] / :term[view] and the order appears to follow some logic.

**Notes:**
- The :term[Common Keyboard Navigation Techniques] are considered logical by default
- Having the navigation follow a consistent pattern on the page would be an indication of logic (if it is not consistently random).
- A strictly start-to-end order is not required.
- Linear means in a single direction (forward/backward) - and is not required as long the non-linear  (x-y) technique is in the Common Keyboard Navigation Techniques or is described on the page or where the user will encounter it prior.

**Expected results**
- #1 is true
