If any keyboard action needed to navigate, perceive, and operate the full content of the :term[page] / :term[view] is not a :term[common keyboard navigation technique], then it is described in the :term[page] / :term[view] where it is required or on a :term[page] / :term[view] earlier in the :term[process] where it is used. 

:::note
Any platform related functions are not the responsibility of the author as long as they are not overridden by the content. Examples:

- <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd></kbd> to move through elements
- Sticky Keys functionality that allows single key activation of multi-key commands
