A common pattern is having a component that contains a linked image and some linked text, where both links go to the same content. Someone using screen reading software can be disoriented from the unnecessary chatter, and a keyboard user has to navigate through more tab stops than should be necessary. Combining adjacent links that go to the same content improves the user experience.
