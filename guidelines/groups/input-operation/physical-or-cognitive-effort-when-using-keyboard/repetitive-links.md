Repetitive adjacent links that have the same destination are avoided.

:::ednote
Supplemental if applicable to all :term[content], else best practice.

:::note
A common pattern is having a :term[component] that contains a linked :term[image] and some linked :term[text], where both links go to the same content. Someone using screen reading software can be disoriented from the unnecessary chatter, and a keyboard user has to navigate through more tab stops than should be necessary. Combining adjacent links that go to the same content improves the user experience.
