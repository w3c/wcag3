Within a :term[view], when :term[keyboard focus] moves from one context to another, whether automatically or by user request, the :term[keyboard focus] is preserved so that, when the user goes back to the previous context, the :term[keyboard focus] is restored to its previous location.

:::note
An example of this would be when a modal dialog or other pop up opens.

:::note
This is also quite useful when moving between pages but this would usually have to be done by the browser unless the user is in some process where that information is stored in a cookie or on the server between pages in the process.
