Disability-related vulnerability information is not disclosed to or used by third parties and algorithms (including AI, “user navigation trackers” for UX folks to see how people use the page and possibly give AT information to UX teams). This should include implied disability, such as noticing difficulties with numbers, or use of language suggesting mental health disability or vulnerability.
