Methods &amp; best practices

- Method: Provide unique, descriptive text or image (icon) for each interactive element. 
- Best Practice: Ensure clarity by pairing an icon with a persistent visible text label or only use a persistent visible text label. 
- Best Practice: When an icon is the only visual label, provide a tooltip (hover label) with the text description.
