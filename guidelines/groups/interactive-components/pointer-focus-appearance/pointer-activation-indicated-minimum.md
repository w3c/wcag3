title: Pointer activation indicated (minimum)
type: foundational

There is a visible indication of the activation of an interactive element when selected by the :term[pointer].

**Applicable when:** The platform does not use a visible pointer indicator.

:::note
This is primarily aimed at touch-interfaces and VR where you don’t have a pointer indicator, but do need to know when something has been selected.
