type: supplemental

The user can choose to always have a visible :term[pointer] indicator.

**Applicable when:** The platform does not use a visible pointer indicator.

:::note
This is primarily aimed at eye-tracking and touch-screens, where it is useful for the user to be able to have a visible indicator, but it wouldn't be universal (i.e., it might get in the way for some users).
