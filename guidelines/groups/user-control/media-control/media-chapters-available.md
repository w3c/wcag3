Audio or video that lasts five minutes or longer can be navigated by chapters.

**Except when**

- The media is a piece of music that the composer has not divided into movements.

:::example
Gustav Mahler's <cite>Symphony Number 5</cite> is approximately 70 minutes long and is divided into five movements. Each movement would be a chapter.
:::

:::example
Iron Maiden's <cite>Rime Of The Ancient Mariner</cite> is approximately 14 minutes long and isn't divided into movements. This meets the exception and would not need to be divided into chapters.
