If the platform has a :term[default orientation], content supports that orientation. If the platform does not have a default orientation, content supports both portrait and landscape orientations.

:::except-when
* Content is aligned with the physical world.
* The orientation is :term[essential].
:::

:::note
For extended reality, the platform default orientation aligns with the real world orientation.
:::

:::note
Content does not have to re-layout or change aspect ratio in a different orientation, it just needs to display in the device orientation.
