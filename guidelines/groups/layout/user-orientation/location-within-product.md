title: Location within product (Assertion)
---

[Title, role, or organization] asserts that:

* Reviewed conventions for presenting current location within a product or process.
* The presentation of current location within a product or process uses appropriate visually and programmatically patterns.

:::note
It is often helpful for users to understand where within a product they are. There are many ways to achieve this, for example, a breadcrumb. Ideally this is consistently presented throughout the product but for some pages/views it may make less sense to include. For example, including a breadcrumb trail on the homepage or on pages that sit outside the hierarchy, for example a shopping cart.
:::

## Information that needs to be included publicly

* Title, role or organization making the assertion (if different from the conformance claim).
* Date of assertion (if different from the date of the conformance claim).

## Recommended internal documentation (Informative)

* Design log capturing decision to use specific approaches to current location patterns used within the product.
* If a non-convention design pattern is used, usability testing results that demonstrate the utility of the design approach taken.
