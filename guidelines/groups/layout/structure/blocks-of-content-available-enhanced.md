<i>Visually identifiable meaningful blocks of content</i>

<b>Procedure</b>

For each meaningful block of content in the page/view:
1. Check that each meaningful block of content is grouped by one or more of the following characteristics:
    * Color or lightness — the same color scheme is used (Note that this should also meet requirements for 'Color alone' and 'Contrast')
    * Borders — blocks are contained within the same borders
    * Spacing — blocks are grouped based on their proximity to others within the same area, while spacing is used to separate different sections of content
    * Font — blocks are presented with similar font families
    * Position — blocks are located in the same area of the page/view (for example, header, navigation, footer)
    * Repeated visual feature — blocks contain a consistent visual feature (for example, bullets in a list, checkbox)

<b>Expected results</b>
* #1 is true
