:term[Audio descriptions] are available in live :term[video] for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media. 

:::ednote
* Is this even possible?
* Should we remove "for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media." since it should be a part of the definition of audio description rather than a part of the requirement?
  * Common issue with "Audio description prerecorded" requirement.
