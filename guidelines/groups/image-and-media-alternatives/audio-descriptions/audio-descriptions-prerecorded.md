:term[Audio descriptions] are available for significant visual content in prerecorded multimedia, except when the multimedia content is an alternative for text and clearly labelled as such.

:::note
WCAG 3 needs to specify how to handle multimedia with audio that does not include gaps to insert audio descriptions. Two possible solutions are providing an exception that allows the content author(s) to use descriptive transcripts instead or requiring content authors to provide an extended audio description.
