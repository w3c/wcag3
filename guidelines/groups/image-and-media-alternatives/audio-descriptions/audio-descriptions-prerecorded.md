:term[Audio descriptions] are available in prerecorded :term[video] for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media.

:::ednote
* WCAG 3 needs to specify how to handle video content with :term[audio] that does not include gaps to insert audio descriptions. Two possible solutions are providing an exception that allows the :term[content author(s)] to use :term[descriptive transcripts] instead or requiring content authors to provide an :term[extended audio description].
* Should we remove "for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media." since it should be a part of the definition of audio description rather than a part of the requirement?
