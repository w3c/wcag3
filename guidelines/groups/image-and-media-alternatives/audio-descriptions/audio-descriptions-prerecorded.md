:term[Audio descriptions] are available in prerecorded :term[video] for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media, except when the video content is an alternative for text and clearly labelled as such.

:::ednote

Two possible solutions are providing an exception that allows the content author(s) to use descriptive transcripts instead or requiring content authors to provide an extended audio description.
