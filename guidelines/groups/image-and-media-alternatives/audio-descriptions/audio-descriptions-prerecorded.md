:term[Audio descriptions] are available for significant visual :term[content] in prerecorded :term[video], except when the video content is an alternative for text and clearly labelled as such.

:::ednote
WCAG 3 needs to specify how to handle video content with audio that does not include gaps to insert audio descriptions. Two possible solutions are providing an exception that allows the content author(s) to use descriptive transcripts instead or requiring content authors to provide an extended audio description.
