:term[Audio descriptions] are available in prerecorded :term[video] for visual :term[content] needed to understand the media, except when the video content is an alternative for text and clearly labelled as such.

:::ednote
WCAG 3 needs to specify how to handle video content with :term[audio] that does not include gaps to insert audio descriptions. Two possible solutions are providing an exception that allows the content author(s) to use :term[descriptive transcripts] instead or requiring content authors to provide an :term[extended audio description].
