Visual indicators in extended reality environments are provided to indicate where the speaker is or the direction of a sound when audio is heard from outside the current view. As users move in extended reality environments, the position of the audio may stay the same. Users can personalize the visual indicators by selecting from a set of options.

:::example
* **Visual indicators:** An arrow with an outline pointing to the speaker or the direction of a sound
* **Customizable styles:** Users can select various arrow sizes, colors, and outline colors
