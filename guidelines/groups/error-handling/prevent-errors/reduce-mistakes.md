title: Design to reduce mistakes 
---

[Title, role or organization] assert that, for each form in the conformance claim, we have reviewed the form designs to reduce the possibility of users making mistakes. This review includes checking to make sure that we:

* make the user enter as little information as possible,
* clearly indicate required fields,
for long numbers, divide input fields into chunks (supporting autocomplete across fields),
* use an interface where only valid input can be selected,
* use autocomplete and personalization of form controls,
* use common words and metrics or units that users are likely to be familiar with,
* automatically correct input errors when possible and reliable, and
* provide the user with known suggestions and corrections.


Information that needs to be included:

* Title, role or organization making the assertion
* Date of assertion
* Recommended internal documentation (Informative)
* Documentation of which forms were reviewed
* Documentation of any changes made as a result of the review
* Date of usability testing, if applicable
