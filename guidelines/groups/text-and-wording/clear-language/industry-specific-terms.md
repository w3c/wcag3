* For content that is intended for a specialized audience rather than the general public, the organization has a documented process for determining which uncommon words or phrases:
  * Are industry-specific terms that its intended audience is expected to know
  * Are not industry-specific terms and can be replaced with common words to reduce cognitive load and increase ease of reading, such as replacing “utilize” with “use” and “elucidate” with “make clear.”
