:::applies-when 
* a human language has a version that removes letters or diacritics for proficient readers.
:::

:::note
A diacritic is a small mark that is added to a letter or character that changes how it is pronounced or what it means. Diacritics may appear above, below, within, or between letters or characters.:::

:::note
Hebrew and Arabic are examples of human languages that omit letters or diacritics for proficient readers.
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word אמר, with three consonants and no diacritics
* Without diacritics, אמר can represent different verb and noun forms of “to say.”
* Readers must rely on context to determine the intended pronunciation and meaning.
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">אָמַר</span>, with diacritics under two of the three consonants
* Two perpendicular marks (similar to an uppercase T) under the א makes an “ah” sound.
* A horizontal mark under the מ makes a short “a” sound.
* Pronunciation: ah-mar
* Meaning: "He said"
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">יֹאמַר</span>, with diacritics above one consonant and under another
* A prefix mark (similar to a floating hook or a comma-like dash) indicates future tense, masculine.
* A dot above the prefix makes an "o" sound.
* A horizontal mark under the מ makes a short “a” sound.
* Pronunciation: yo-mar
* Meaning: "He will say"
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">אֹמֶר</span>, with a different set of diacritics above one consonant and under another
* A dot that is above and between the first two letters makes an “o” sound.
* The three dots (like a downward-pointing triangle) under the מ make a short “e” sound.
* Pronunciation: oh-mer
* Meaning: "utterance; saying" (noun)
