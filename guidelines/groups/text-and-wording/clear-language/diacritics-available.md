Diacritics required to identify the correct meaning of each word are available.

:::applies-when 
* a :term[human language] has a version that removes diacritics for proficient readers.
:::

:::note
A diacritic is a small mark that is added to a letter or character that changes how it is pronounced or what it means. Diacritics may appear above, below, within, or between letters or characters.
:::

:::note
Hebrew and Arabic are examples of human languages that omit diacritics for proficient readers.
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">אמר</span>, with three consonants and no diacritics
* Without diacritics to represent the vowels, <span lang="he">אמר</span> can represent different verb and noun forms of “to say.”
* Readers must rely on context to determine the intended pronunciation and meaning.
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">אָמַר</span>, with diacritics under two of the three consonants
* A diacritic (whose unicode looks similar to an uppercase T) under the א makes an “ah” sound.
* A horizontal mark under the מ makes a short “a” sound.
* Pronunciation: ah-mar
* Meaning: "He said"
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">יֹאמַר</span>, with diacritics in front of the first consonant and under another
* A mark (that looks similar to a floating comma) in front of the word indicates future tense, masculine.
* A dot above the prefix makes an "o" sound.
* A horizontal mark under the מ makes a short “a” sound.
* Pronunciation: yo-mar
* Meaning: "He will say"
:::

:::example
The Hebrew word <span lang="he">אֹמֶר</span>, with a different set of diacritics above one consonant and under another
* A dot above the first letter makes an “o” sound.
* Three dots forming a small triangle under the מ make a short “e” sound.
* Pronunciation: oh-mer
* Meaning: "utterance; saying" (noun)
