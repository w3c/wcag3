:::tests

For each sentence:
1. Identify all nested clauses in the sentence (introduced by nesting conjunctions such as ‘because’, ‘although’, ‘if’, ‘that’, ‘which’, ‘who’, ‘when’, and ‘where’).

2. Check that each initial nested clause does not contain other nested clauses within it.

3. Check that a technology in the accessibility support set meets ‘No nested clauses’. 

Expected result:
* #2 is true, or
* #3 is true.
