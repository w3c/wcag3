Common words are used, and definitions are available for uncommon words. 

<div class="issue" data-number="425"></div>

:::applies-when
* human languages have more than 1,500 words
:::

:::except-when
* the words are for names of people or places, or
* the language does not have a :term[high-frequency corpus].
:::

:::note 
This requirement is not foundational because a list of common words would not cover terms that are known by specific audiences, such as accounting terms on an accounting site. However, in future guidance for policy makers, it is an example of a supplemental requirement that could be made mandatory for public service and education providers.

Lists of common words are called high-frequency corpora. They exist for many languages including Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin, and Russian as well as American English, British English, and Canadian English.

:::ednote
Research shows that using common words and defining uncommon words improves understanding. [Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities] recommends using the 1,500 highest-frequency words or phrases because people with severe language impairments are most likely to know these terms. However, more research is needed to confirm if the same threshold applies to many languages for distinguishing common from uncommon words.

<b>Procedure</b>

For each word: 
1. Check whether the word appears in the 1,500 most common words in a high-frequency corpus for the language used.
2. If the word is not in the list of the 1,500 most common words, check that it has a definition available within the page/view.
3. Check that a technology in the accessibility support set meets ‘Common words.’

<b>Expected results</b>
* #1, #2, or #3 is true.
