:::ednote
This :term[requirement] will include :term[tests] and techniques for identifying common words for the intended audience. The intended audience may be the public or a specialized group such as children or experts.

For example: In :term[content] intended for the public, one technique for determining what counts as a common word is to use a high-frequency corpus. These corpora exist for many languages including Arabic, Hindi, Mandarin, and Russian as well as American English, British English, and Canadian English. Exceptions will be made for any language that does not have a high-frequency corpus.
