:::ednote
This guideline will include exceptions for poetic, scriptural, artistic, and other content whose main goal is expressive rather than informative.

To ensure this guideline works well across different languages,
members of AG, COGA, and internationalization (i18n) agreed on an initial set of languages to pressure-test the guidance.

The five "guardrail" languages are:

- Arabic
- English
- Hindi
- Mandarin 
- Russian

We started with the six official languages of the United Nations (UN). Then we removed French and Spanish because they are similar to English. We added Hindi because it is the most commonly spoken language that is not on the UN list.

The group of five languages includes a wide variety of language features, such as:

- Right-to-left text layout 
- Vertical text layout
- Tonal sounds that affect meaning

This list doesn't include every language, but it helps keep the work manageable while making the guidance more useful for a wide audience.

We will work with W3C’s Global Inclusion community group, the Internationalization (i18n) task force, and others to review and refine the testing and techniques for these requirements.
We also plan to create guidance for translating the guidelines into more languages in the future.
