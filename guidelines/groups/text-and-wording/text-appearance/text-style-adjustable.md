The presentation of each of the following :term[text] :term[style properties] can be adjusted, without loss of content or functionality, to meet the corresponding values for the content’s language, or, if the language is not listed in the table, of the language listed with the most similar orthography.

:::note
The requirement is that the text is manipulable and the style attributes can be overridden.
:::

:::except-when
* the text style property is hard-coded, such as raw text that is capitalized or hyphenated.

:::ednote
The metrics in the following table are still to be determined; the current content is an example.

:::note
[Blocks of text readable (minimum)](#blocks-of-text-readable-minimum) and [Text style readable (minimum)](#text-style-readable-minimum) are based on common usage, and their adjustable and enhanced counterparts are based on readability research. We need more readability research in these languages.
