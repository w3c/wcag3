AGWG remains committed to providing Text Appearance guidance for multiple
scripts and/or languages. To support our internationalization goals, AGWG is exploring
ways to:

- not require WCAG 3 to be republished when metrics are added for more scripts/languages,
- make script/language-specific metrics normative,
- meet the needs of different scripts and languages by allowing flexibility in which metrics are required and in their values, and
- preserve backward compatibility.
