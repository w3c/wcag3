AGWG remains committed to providing Text Appearance guidance for multiple
languages. To support our internationalization goals, AGWG is exploring
ways to:

- not require WCAG 3 to be republished when metrics are added for more
  languages,
- make language-specific metrics normative,
- meet the needs of different languages and scripts by allowing
   flexibility in which metrics are required and in their values, and
- preserve backward compatibility.
